      <h2>Creating the software of <span>the future</span></h2>
      <p class="intro">
        Software is similar to art. It can be elegent, short in a way that does
        not obscure meaning but instead brings meaning to the forefront of our
        attention.

          <h3>Associate Software Engineer</h3>
          <p>
            Participated in Full-Stack Engineering (FSE) track of the 4-month
            Fidelity LEAP program, covering frontend development using Angular
            (including unit testing with Jasmine and e2e testing with Cypress),
            middle-tier development using Java with Spring and MyBatis,
            middle-tier development with Node.js (including Express), backend
            development with Relational Databases and SQL, as well as some basic
            development and strategy for the Cloud.
          </p>
          <p>
            Experience culminated in a Business Unit sponsored project to create
            a dashboard displaying the latest environment-specific test results
            for our various services, organized to quickly locate any bugs and
            failures. This helped address the difficulty of monitoring the
            health of non-production environments caused by the natural
            abstraction of APIs and the inadequacy of health check endpoints to
            address this issue.
