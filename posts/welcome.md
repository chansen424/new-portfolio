# About Me

Hello, I'm Christopher Hansen. This blog will be the place where I document my journey as a budding software engineer.

Currently I am a senior (Decemeber 2021) at Cornell University studying Computer Science. Most of my experience is in web development, having had multiple summer internships and spent time developing on the student project team, Cornell Design & Tech Initiative, where I eventually became a Developer Lead.

Right now I am looking for full-time employment! Check out my resume in my [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MO73a-UpyMBuWugO0FLdqRG8NFrsu5QbtiAEY0CbOao/edit?usp=sharing).
